  - **White Circle:** Use on dark backgrounds for visibility (`/public/white_circle_360x360.png`).
  - **Black Circle:** Use on light backgrounds for visibility (`/public/black_circle_360x360.png`).
  - **Text Only:** Use on dark backgrounds if preferred (`/public/logotext_poweredby_360w.png`).

**Example Implementation:**
```jsx
<a href="https://bolt.new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="/public/white_circle_360x360.png" alt="Built with Bolt.new" style={{ width: 64, height: 64 }} />
